# Flaws Log (append-only — flows to the protocol package)

Friction caused by the `.context_ledger/` system or the protocol itself. See
`README.md` in this directory for the split between `flaws/` and
`inefficiencies/`.

Append-only, but compactable — the log never grows without bound:

- **Resolved entries move verbatim** to cold storage: once an entry is
  explicitly marked `RESOLVED` / `superseded` / fixed, cut it unchanged
  into `archive.md` in this directory so startup reads only the live
  entries. Age alone never makes an entry eligible — an unresolved flaw
  stays here as a live trap.
- **Repeats roll up:** when 3+ entries describe the same recurring
  protocol trap, append ONE consolidated `Recurring` entry — the pattern,
  how many times, the current workaround — and move the individual
  entries verbatim into `archive.md`. The live log keeps the pattern, not
  the repeats.

`ledger-mem prune` reports log sizes, archive-eligible entries (`--list`
names them), and roll-up candidates.

<!-- TEMPLATE — copy below the last entry:
---
## YYYY-MM-DD — <agent> / <model> (Session N)

- **Flaw:** <what in the protocol or .context_ledger/ system didn't work>
- **Symptom:** <what happened to the agent — the observable friction>
- **Root cause:** <why the protocol/.context_ledger/ let this happen>
- **Suggested fix:** <concrete change to the package — a step, a pitfall,
  a template, a rule>
- **Status:** open | fixed in package <commit-sha or date>
