# Agent Instructions — <PROJECT_NAME>

<!-- Generated at bootstrap from .context_ledger/core/templates/AGENTS.md.
Refreshed on core updates (fill <PROJECT_NAME> again). This is the canonical
entrypoint digest. Bootstrap also installs a CLAUDE.md pointer so Claude
Code (which auto-loads CLAUDE.md, not this file) is routed here. If the
project uses other agent tools, add a one-line "read AGENTS.md first"
pointer to their entrypoint too — Copilot: .github/copilot-instructions.md,
Cursor: .cursor/rules, Gemini: GEMINI.md, Codex/others: this AGENTS.md. -->

This repo uses the `.context_ledger/` protocol: persistent agent memory plus a
vendored copy of the full workflow, committed to git. **Before doing any
work, read `.context_ledger/kickoff.md` and follow it.** It routes you — local
IDE agent or cloud/sandbox agent — to the right instruction set in
`.context_ledger/core/rules/`.

If you read nothing else, obey these rules:

1. **Start at `.context_ledger/kickoff.md`.** Do not treat "start the context
   workflow" as running this project's app, and do not grep the codebase
   for "context" — the protocol lives in the `.context_ledger/` directory.
2. **Never write under `.context_ledger/core/`** — it is a read-only, versioned
   copy of the protocol. All project memory you write lives under
   `.context_ledger/memory/` — the live office in `memory/office/`, the
   durable files (workflows, collaboration, system, user, overrides,
   secrets) at the memory root.
3. **Pick your instruction set by YOUR agent type**, never by what a
   previous session recorded: local IDE agent →
   `.context_ledger/core/rules/ai-engineering-protocol-local.md`; cloud/sandbox
   agent → `.context_ledger/core/rules/ai-engineering-protocol.md`. Local
   agents never use PATs or clone this repo; cloud steps are not yours.
4. **Read memory before working** — but sign the roster first (rule 5):
   at minimum
   `.context_ledger/memory/workflows/active.md`,
   `.context_ledger/memory/office/agents/sessions.md` (last entries),
   `.context_ledger/memory/office/agents/roster.md` (the "who's in the office" board —
   a live row you didn't write means a peer is here),
   `.context_ledger/memory/collaboration/README.md` and relevant event files
   when collaboration is enabled, `.context_ledger/memory/workflows/gates.conf`,
   `.context_ledger/memory/office/tasks/current.md`, and
   `.context_ledger/memory/office/inefficiencies/log.md` (known traps). If the
   active session has detailed notes at
   `.context_ledger/memory/office/sessions/`, skim them for current state.
5. **Check in first — at the entrance, before any analysis.** Every session
   (solo or collaboration) adds or updates its row in
   `memory/office/agents/roster.md` — real name you pick (unique per office),
   codename `S<NNN>`, model, one line on what you're on, and a Status
   (`Working` at sign-in, then `Done` or `Blocked`) with a one-line
   status detail (the stage reached, what shipped — "Shipped: …", or the
   blocker) — and pushes it
   BEFORE reading protocol or product code: the startup read comes after
   your row is on the board, because two workers who read first both see
   an empty office, both take the same codename, and meet mid-session
   fighting over the main tree. Keep your row's Status cells current as
   the work moves — the next live worker reads them to coordinate with
   you at a glance. The push claims the codename — whoever's
   check-in commit lands first keeps it; on a collision fix your row to
   the next free number, never drop a peer's row. And if the session registry you read at the door is already
   past `office_size` sessions (default 20 — your codename would be
   past S020), the office is full: close it before working
   (`ledger-history close`, dry run then `--confirm`), fill the
   permanent record, re-seed open threads into the fresh office —
   re-seeded entries describe the work in plain words and never cite
   old session numbers or codenames — then sign the new board;
   codenames restart at `S001`. Then choose the mode
   from evidence. Roster edits are additive — your row only: a live
   row you didn't write is a colleague's check-in, not sample text — never
   adopt a peer's name, never let an edit span a peer's row, review the
   `git diff` (exactly your row, `+1` on check-in) before committing.
   Claim an identity; never infer one: a row whose model string matches
   yours is a peer, not you — model IDs and harness markers are shared by
   every session on that harness or model, and a fresh context can never
   prove it is a prior session. "That row is mine" only with continuity in
   your own session (the re-check-in rule) or the user's word.
   You
   are solo only when there is no shared
   collaboration `session` + `issue`, no live roster row you didn't
   write, and `office/tasks/current.md` is idle; otherwise coordinate (join or
   declare a session, isolated worktree/branch, `note` + `claim`) — a
   peer in the office is a teammate, not a rival, and the human is your
   supervisor: do not block teammates on `office/tasks/current.md`. Present
   yourself by your name — "John (S427)", never "peer". The everyday move
   is a
   `note` (the office channel — say what you're on, flag a coworker, review a
   diff); then `claim → work → release`. Save the `proposal → assessment → agreement`
   ceremony for a genuine conflict (same paths, incompatible changes).
   Tear down what you set up: at clock-out remove your product worktree
   and delete your branch (`-d` refuses unmerged) — the coordination
   branch is the session's event trail and stays.
   Before each next action run `ledger-gates checkpoint`; before commits,
   integration, and exit run the matching gate. On Windows, use the `.cmd`
   launchers (they run the `.ps1` ports; no execution-policy setup).
6. **Know which kind of file you're in.** *Append-only* logs
   (`office/agents/sessions.md`, `office/plans/decisions.md`,
   `office/flaws/log.md`, `office/inefficiencies/log.md`) grow at the bottom — never edit
   or delete past entries. They also never grow without bound — compact
   them: a clean session appends nothing to the friction logs; entries
   explicitly marked `RESOLVED`/`superseded`/fixed move verbatim into the
   log's `archive.md`; 3+ entries hitting the same recurring thing roll up
   into one `Recurring` entry (instances archived verbatim);
   `ledger-mem prune` reports all three. `office/tasks/backlog.md` is a live queue
   arranged as priority-grouped tables: add each open item as a row in
   its priority table (High/Medium/Low, `ID | Summary`), delete the row
   when its item is finished (the completion record is the session
   entry + commit, not a tombstone); `ledger-mem closeout` sweeps
   checked-off tombstones from legacy checkbox-format backlogs.
   *Update-in-place* registries
   (`system/ai-models.md`, `system/environments.md`) have one entry per key:
   correct them by **editing** the entry, never by appending a duplicate
   (its old value is in git history). `ledger-mem check` flags a dup key.
   Collaboration event files are stronger still: immutable, one event per
   file; emit a correction instead of editing one. Office files are
   office-scoped: when the office fills up, `ledger-history close` freezes
   the whole directory verbatim into `history/` and the next office starts
   from empty skeletons — open threads are re-seeded explicitly.
7. **No secrets in tracked files, ever.** Values go only in
   `.context_ledger/memory/secrets/` (self-gitignored). Never echo a secret or
   token in chat, logs, or commit messages.
8. **Two surfaces, two prefixes:** editing product code = normal commit
   prefixes; editing `.context_ledger/` = `chore(ledger):` (reports:
   `docs(review):`). Never mix both surfaces in one commit. Collaboration
   events are separate immutable context commits. And keep the surfaces
   apart in *content* too — strictly: never cite `.context_ledger`
   vocabulary (an ADR number, a bug ID, a `.context_ledger/` path) in a
   product docstring or comment; it's a dangling pointer for anyone
   reading only the product repo. `ledger-mem lint` flags it in your
   staged diff; `ledger-mem lint --tree` sweeps the whole product tree.
   **A leak found from an earlier session is stripped on sight** — drop
   the reference (state the reason in plain words if one was being
   pointed at), commit the strip as a normal product fix, and continue
   the session; never leave a known leak in place or defer it to a
   backlog.
9. **The session is not done until everything is committed AND pushed**,
   the session is logged in `.context_ledger/memory/office/agents/sessions.md`, and
   `.context_ledger/memory/office/tasks/current.md` is cleared. Clock out too: remove
   your row from `.context_ledger/memory/office/agents/roster.md` in the closing
   memory commit, so the board shows who is in the office now — but only
   when you are actually leaving. The session is not over until the user
   says so; if you clocked out and the supervisor brings more work, check
   back in first (re-add your row, same name and codename `S<N>`) and
   extend your existing `sessions.md` entry — never a second `Session N`.
   If the user has to remind you to commit or push, that is a protocol
   failure — log it in `.context_ledger/memory/office/flaws/log.md`.
10. **Don't ask permission for the default next step.** Do it and
    report. Ask only on genuine ambiguity or destructive/irreversible
    actions.

Formats and file rules: `.context_ledger/core/schemas/ledger-schema.md` is
the single source of truth. Project-specific rule adjustments:
`.context_ledger/memory/overrides/rules.md` (they win over the edition).
