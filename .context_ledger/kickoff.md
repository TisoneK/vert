# Project Kickoff — `.context_ledger/` Workflow Entry Point (Inbound)

<!-- GENERATED AT BOOTSTRAP — the universal kickoff's bootstrap step fills
this in. This file is project DATA: core updates never overwrite it. If
its template (.context_ledger/core/templates/kickoff.md) materially changes in a
core release, the next session regenerates it and refills the facts.

Generation rules for the bootstrapping agent:
1. Fill every fact <PLACEHOLDER> OUTSIDE this HTML comment — in "Project
   Facts", in the intro blockquote (the clone URL), AND in the Entry
   Steps code blocks — from the external kickoff's Pre-Flight + what you
   verified on disk (git remote, default branch). Facts you verified
   beat facts the user typed — record what's true. The ONLY placeholders
   that stay symbolic are the token forms
   (`<..._WITH_TOKEN_IF_PRIVATE>`, `${GIT_TOKEN}`) — never a real token.
   After filling, scan:
   `grep -n "<PROJECT\|<GIT_\|<LIVE_\|<REPO>" .context_ledger/kickoff.md` —
   hits are allowed only inside this comment and in the token forms.
2. Do NOT copy session parameters here — they live in
   memory/workflows/active.md (single source of truth). This file only
   points at them.
3. Do NOT put secrets, PATs, or tokens anywhere in this file. Ever.
4. Delete nothing else — the Entry Steps below are pre-written and
   correct for every post-bootstrap session. Fill their fact
   placeholders (rule 1) but change no step logic.
5. Keep facts current in later sessions: if a fact changes (repo renamed,
   new default branch, live URL added), update it in place and note the
   change in your session entry.

## Project Facts (generated — keep current)

- **Project name:** Vert
- **Project repository URL:** https://github.com/TisoneK/vert.git
- **Project repo privacy:** Public _(verified 2026-07-14 — unauthenticated GitHub API returns 200)_
- **Default branch:** main _(branch protection ON since 2026-09-15: force-push + deletion blocked, admin enforcement — normal direct pushes still work)_
- **Live application:** https://vert-wine.vercel.app/ — Vercel production deployment (auto-redeploy on push to `main`); hosted watch verification performed 2026-08-08
- **Git identity:** Tisone Kironget `tisonkironget@gmail.com`
- **Protocol:** vendored at `.context_ledger/core/` (version: see `.context_ledger/core/VERSION`)
- **Package upstream (core updates + flaw back-ports):** https://github.com/TisoneK/context-ledger.git
- **Edition routing:** local agents → `.context_ledger/core/rules/ai-engineering-protocol-local.md`; cloud/sandbox agents → `.context_ledger/core/rules/ai-engineering-protocol.md`

## Session Parameters

Standing defaults live in
[`memory/workflows/active.md`](memory/workflows/active.md) — scope,
target, push policy, deliverable, commit style. **A target in the
user's chat message overrides the standing Target.** If the chat
message is just "start," use the standing Target.

**Agent identity:** never guess your model version. If your system
prompt states the exact model ID, record that; otherwise ask the user
once, or record `unknown`.

---

## Entry Steps (every session after bootstrap)

### Step 0 — Identify your agent type, get the project on disk

- **Local agent** — you are already inside the repo. Confirm:
  `git remote get-url origin` matches the Project repository URL.
  **Never re-clone the project. No PAT, ever** — your pushes use the
  user's own credentials; if one fails with an auth error, stop and
  tell the user.
- **Cloud/sandbox agent** — clone the project repo only:

  ```bash
  # If private: PAT from chat — strip it from .git/config right after.
  # A missing credential is a missing input: if the repo is private (or
  # you'll push, which you will) and no PAT arrived in chat, ask NOW.
  git clone <PROJECT_REPO_URL_WITH_TOKEN_IF_PRIVATE> vert && cd vert
  git remote set-url origin https://github.com/TisoneK/vert.git
  git config user.name "Tisone Kironget" && git config user.email "tisonkironget@gmail.com"
  ```

There is **no package repo to find, clone, or authenticate against** —
the protocol travels inside this repo at `.context_ledger/core/`.

### Step 1 — Sync the project, check the core

```bash
git pull --ff-only
```

If the pull fails (diverged) or the tree has changes you didn't make,
**stop and report** — don't stash or discard someone else's work.

Then check the vendored protocol (never fatal — a session must never
fail over sync):

```bash
sh .context_ledger/core/bin/ledger-sync verify    # integrity: core matches its MANIFEST
sh .context_ledger/core/bin/ledger-sync status    # drift: is a newer core available?
```

On **Windows** (no POSIX shell) run the `.cmd` launcher instead — it runs
the `.ps1` port with `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass` (same commands, same output):

```powershell
.context_ledger/core/bin/ledger-sync.cmd verify
.context_ledger/core/bin/ledger-sync.cmd status
```

- `verify` fails → core was hand-edited or corrupted. Run
  `sh .context_ledger/core/bin/ledger-sync rollback` (Windows:
  `.context_ledger/core/bin/ledger-sync.cmd rollback`), log a flaw in
  `memory/office/flaws/log.md`, continue on the restored core.
- `status` reports a newer core with the **same MAJOR** → run
  `sh .context_ledger/core/bin/ledger-sync update` (Windows:
  `.context_ledger/core/bin/ledger-sync.cmd update`) — it replaces `core/` only,
  memory is never touched — then commit as
  `chore(ledger): update core to <version>`, and read the new
  `core/CHANGELOG.md` entries.
- A **MAJOR** bump, or no update source reachable → note it in your
  session entry and move on with the core you have.

### Step 2 — Sign in at the door, then read `.context_ledger/`

**Check in FIRST — before the deep read, before analysis, before product work.** Signing needs only two files: `memory/office/agents/roster.md` (the board) and the last entry of `memory/office/agents/sessions.md` (the next free session number). Read just those two, pick a real name you like (unique in the office), add your row — name, codename `S<NNN>`, model, one line on what you're on, and your starting Status `Working` with a status detail naming the stage you've reached — commit, and push it now: `chore(ledger): <name> (<codename>) checks in — <task>`. The push claims your codename: whoever's check-in commit is already on origin keeps the number, and if a concurrent check-in surfaces on your rebase the earlier commit wins — renumber **your own row only** to the next free codename, never a peer's. Keep your row's Status cells current as the work moves (`Done` + what shipped, or `Blocked` + the blocker) — the next live worker coordinates with you off that board at a glance. A worker who reads protocol and product code before signing checks in late: two workers launched together then both see an empty board, both take the same codename, and meet mid-session as strangers arguing over the main tree. Everything below comes AFTER your row is pushed. (Full check-in, identity, and mode rules follow the read list.)

**Full office? Close it at the door, before the deep read.** The
registry entry you just read tells you the office's age: if
`agents/sessions.md` already holds more than `office_size` sessions
(default 20 — the codename you'd claim is past S020), run the close as
part of check-in: `sh .context_ledger/core/bin/ledger-history close`
(dry run prints the checklist; re-run with `--confirm`; Windows: the
`.cmd` launcher). Fill in the permanent record `history/office-<NNN>.md`
and re-seed the open threads that still matter into the fresh office's
`backlog.md` / `decisions.md` / logs — re-seeded entries describe the
work in plain words and **never cite the closed office's session numbers
or codenames** ("as fixed in S014"), which point into the frozen copy the
new office never reads. Then sign the NEW roster: same name, codename
`S001` — numbering restarts in a new office, and old-office numbers never
carry over. (Schema: "The door trigger — a full office closes at
check-in".)

Then read, in order:

`README.md` (the zone map) → then the **live office**, under `memory/office/`:
`agents/sessions.md` (last 3–5 entries —
if the active entry points to `sessions/<date>-N/notes.md`, skim it
for the current state) → `agents/roster.md` (the board by the door:
who is in the office right now — a live row you didn't write means a
peer is here) → the durable files at the memory root:
`workflows/active.md` → `collaboration/README.md` and relevant
`collaboration/events/` when collaboration is enabled → `workflows/gates.conf` →
then back into the office: `office/tasks/current.md` → `office/tasks/backlog.md` →
`office/inefficiencies/log.md` → `office/flaws/log.md` → `office/plans/decisions.md` →
`overrides/rules.md` → `system/` → `user/` → note what's in
`secrets/` (never print values). The office is everything session-produced
(roster, registry, tasks, plans, logs, reviews); `history/` and `archive/`
hold closed offices and are never read at session start.

**Roster edits are additive — your row only.** A live row you didn't
write is a colleague's check-in, not sample text: never adopt a peer's
name, and never let an edit's `old_string` span a peer's row (the edit
tool replaces blocks — anchoring on the table body erases whoever is on
it); after a roster edit the diff must show exactly your own row
(`+1` on check-in) — review `git diff` before committing. If the push
forces a rebase, a peer checked in concurrently — re-read the board
after the rebase: your codename is claimed by your push, and the
earlier commit keeps a colliding number.
**Claim an identity; never infer one.** A live row whose model string
matches yours is a peer, not you — model IDs and harness markers are
fingerprints shared by every session on that harness or model, and a
fresh context can never prove it is a prior session. Register as a new
arrival (fresh name, codename `S<NNN>`); "that row is mine" is
justified only by continuity in your own session (the re-check-in rule
below) or the user's word.
Clock-out (Step 15) is *leaving the office*, not finishing a task — and
the session is not over until the user says so. If you clocked out and
the supervisor brings more work, **check back in before touching
anything**: re-add your row under the same name and codename `S<N>`, and
extend your existing session entry rather than opening a second one.

**Decide the mode from evidence, not from an empty board.** You are
solo only if no collaboration `session` + `issue` was declared AND the
roster shows no live row you didn't write AND `memory/office/tasks/current.md`
is idle. A live roster row you didn't write means a peer is in the
office: do not run a solo protocol — fetch and check for a
`collab/<session-id>/coordination` branch and join its event trail; if
none exists, declare a shared session/issue (mind the peer's "Doing"
scope), take your own isolated worktree/branch, and emit a `note` +
`claim` before editing. If `office/tasks/current.md` shows a live session but
the roster is empty (an old-core or crashed session), follow the
stale-entry guidance on `current.md`; when it is genuinely live,
**do not start** — one agent per project repo at a time. If collaboration
was declared, do not use `office/tasks/current.md` as a lock: create or join the
shared session/issue event trail, use a separate worktree/branch, publish
a claim, and inspect peer events before editing. Two sessions that both
signed as solo and discover each other afterwards: the board now shows
both — resolve the main tree by conversation, not by racing. Whoever has
product work already in flight keeps the main tree; the other takes an
isolated branch/worktree off origin/main, and both declare the shared
session/issue before further edits.

Peers are one team, not rivals. The everyday move is a `note` — the office
channel. Then `claim → work → release`. Reach for the
`proposal → assessment → agreement` ceremony only for a genuine conflict.

```bash
# say what you're on (informal, never gates the check):
sh .context_ledger/core/bin/ledger-collab emit note --session <SESSION_ID> \
  --agent <AGENT_ID> --issue <ISSUE_ID> --to <PEER_ID> --re <path> \
  --body "Taking the web side; leaving the loop to you."
# claim scope, then release it citing the commit:
sh .context_ledger/core/bin/ledger-collab emit claim --session <SESSION_ID> \
  --agent <AGENT_ID> --issue <ISSUE_ID> --paths <path1,path2> \
  --body-file <claim-notes-file>
sh .context_ledger/core/bin/ledger-collab status --session <SESSION_ID> --issue <ISSUE_ID>
sh .context_ledger/core/bin/ledger-collab check --session <SESSION_ID> --issue <ISSUE_ID>
```

`status` opens with a **Recent chatter** feed of notes — read it first. A
`release`/`handoff` closes a claim by citing its event ID or by sharing its
session+issue and overlapping paths, so citing only the commit SHA is fine.
On Windows use `.context_ledger/core/bin/ledger-collab.cmd` with the
same `emit`, `status`, and `check` arguments.

Publish coordination events on the shared event-only branch
`collab/<SESSION_ID>/coordination`; keep product changes on each agent's
isolated `collab/<SESSION_ID>/<AGENT_ID>` branch/worktree. Overlapping
claims are resolved by peer assessment and an agreement that selects the
best-supported option and one implementation owner. There is no timestamp
or agent-ID winner. A correction similarly records evidence, root cause,
candidate repairs, and a suggested owner; peers agree on the repair and
owner before it is applied.

**Tear down what you set up.** After your final `release` and the
integration of your product branch, remove your worktree from a clean
tree (`git status` first — unexplained changes stop you, not `--force`)
and delete your branch (`git branch -d` refuses an unmerged branch; push
`--delete` too if you pushed it). The coordination *branch* is the
session's event trail — later agents fetch it to continue — so it stays;
the coordination *worktree* may be removed by the last agent out and
re-added in one command next time. `git worktree list` should be clean
of your rows before you go.

### Gate commands (every session)

The project-owned registry is `.context_ledger/memory/workflows/gates.conf`.
If it is missing, initialize it with:

```bash
sh .context_ledger/core/bin/ledger-gates init
```

Before the next agent action/turn, run the checkpoint:

```bash
sh .context_ledger/core/bin/ledger-gates checkpoint [--session <SESSION_ID> --issue <ISSUE_ID>]
```

Run the lifecycle gates at their boundaries:

```bash
sh .context_ledger/core/bin/ledger-gates run pre-commit
sh .context_ledger/core/bin/ledger-gates run integration --session <SESSION_ID> --issue <ISSUE_ID>
sh .context_ledger/core/bin/ledger-gates run exit
```

On Windows use `.context_ledger/core/bin/ledger-gates.cmd` with the
same commands. A failing gate blocks the next lifecycle transition; record
the exact failing command and output in the session notes or event trail.

### Step 3 — Load the protocol

Pick the edition by **YOUR agent type** (identified in Step 0), from
the vendored core:

- **Local agent** → `.context_ledger/core/rules/ai-engineering-protocol-local.md`
- **Cloud/sandbox agent** → `.context_ledger/core/rules/ai-engineering-protocol.md`

`memory/workflows/active.md` gives you the standing parameters and any
role overlay — it does **not** choose your edition. If it names a
single edition, that's whichever agent type wrote it last; ignore that
and follow your own type (a local agent must never run the cloud
edition's PAT/clone steps, whatever the memory says). Also read any
role overlay from `.context_ledger/core/roles/`, and the project's overrides
in `memory/overrides/rules.md` (overrides beat the edition, except
secret-handling and append-only rules). Read your edition in full; it
is the instruction set for this session.

### Step 4 — Follow the protocol

All steps, all phases, in order. Don't skip Phase 1 because the task
seems small. In collaboration mode, follow the collaboration event
lifecycle in addition to the normal phases. Don't forget the Exit
checklist: everything committed and pushed, session logged,
`memory/office/tasks/current.md` cleared when you own single-agent mode, roster
row removed (clocked out), chat summary delivered.
