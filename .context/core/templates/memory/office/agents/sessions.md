# Agent Sessions (append-only within the current office)

One entry per agent session in the **current office**, newest at the bottom.
Never edit or delete past entries — append corrections instead. This is not
append-only *forever*: when the office reaches `office_size` sessions (or a
milestone), `ledger-history close` freezes this whole office verbatim into
`.context_ledger/history/office-<NNN>/` (roster, registry, notes, logs —
nothing trimmed), writes the permanent accomplishments record
`.context_ledger/history/office-<NNN>.md`, and opens a fresh empty office
here. Closed offices in `history/` and `archive/` are never read at session
start. Before closing, note which open threads still matter — they are
re-seeded into the new office explicitly, and nothing else carries over.

<!-- TEMPLATE — copy below the last entry and FILL IN every placeholder:
