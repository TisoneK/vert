# .context/ — Agent Memory for This Repo

This directory is the project's institutional memory for AI agents. It is
**committed to git** and travels with the repo: every agent, on every
machine, with any model, pulls the same context — who worked on what, on
which system, what's open, what's decided, and what went wrong before.

The repo's docs (`README`, `docs/`) describe the **product**.
This directory describes the **process**.

```

Every file agents write to carries its entry template in an HTML
comment — at the top of the file itself, or in its directory's README
(`reviews/`, `secrets/`). Read the template before writing; don't
invent formats.

## Two surfaces — know which one you're on

Every repo managed by this protocol has **two surfaces**. An agent
edits one or the other — never both in the same commit — and must know
which one it's on at all times.

1. **The project** — product code, docs, tests, config. Commits use
   normal prefixes (`fix:`, `feat:`, `docs:`). Friction with the project
   (its code, toolchain, environment, dependencies) goes in
   `inefficiencies/log.md`.
2. **`.context/`** — this directory. Agent memory. Commits use
   `chore(context):`. Friction **with the `.context/` system or the
   protocol itself** (a rule that's ambiguous, a step that's missing, a
   template that's confusing) goes in `flaws/log.md`.

If you're editing a file under `.context/`, you're in **memory mode**.
If you're editing anything else, you're in **project mode**. The
protocol's 19 steps apply to both, but the commit prefix and the
friction-logging destination differ. When in doubt: "Am I editing the
project's product, or am I editing the agent's memory of the project?"

## Rules (for agents and humans)

1. **Read before you work.** Agents read this directory at session start
   (sessions → current task → backlog → flaws → inefficiencies → decisions)
   and update it at session end.
2. **Append-only logs are append-only.** `agents/sessions.md`,
   `inefficiencies/log.md`, `flaws/log.md`, `tasks/backlog.md`, and
   `plans/decisions.md` never lose entries. Corrections are appended,
   never edited in. **Exception — exact duplicates:** byte-identical
   entries (same session ID, same date, same content) may be removed to
   deduplicate. When you remove a duplicate, leave a one-line note in
   its place: `Removed duplicate Session N entry (byte-identical to the
   entry above).` This keeps the log clean without erasing history.
3. **Overwrite files are current-state only.** `tasks/current.md`,
   `workflows/active.md`, and the `system/` + `user/` files describe *now*;
   update them in place. History lives in the append-only logs.
4. **No secrets in tracked files — ever.** This directory is committed
   to git. Env var *names* and where secrets live are fine in shared
   files; values belong only in `secrets/`, whose own `.gitignore` keeps
   everything but its README out of git (rules in `secrets/README.md`).
5. **Commit with `chore(context):`.** Context updates are process, not
   product — keep them out of the changelog. One exception: review
   reports in `reviews/` commit as `docs(review):` — they're a
   deliverable, not bookkeeping.
6. **Friction logging is mandatory — and split by surface.** Project
   friction goes in `inefficiencies/log.md`; workflow/protocol friction
   goes in `flaws/log.md`. Both logs are append-only and honest. See
   `flaws/README.md` for the split rule.
7. **Flaws flow to the package.** `flaws/log.md` is the source of truth
   inside this project. Periodically — or when a pattern repeats — the
   flaws here are back-ported to the protocol package at `TisoneK/.context`.
   When a flaw is fixed in the package, append a "Fixed in package" line
   to the entry here; don't delete the original.
8. **Verify before trusting.** Entries reflect what was true when written.
   If the codebase disagrees, the codebase wins — append a correction.
9. **Structure tracks the package; data is yours.** The `README.md` and
   `.gitignore` files here (and `SYNC.md`) are package-owned *structure* — an
   agent syncs them from `context-skeleton/` at session start (see `SYNC.md`).
   Every other file is project-owned *data* and is never overwritten by sync.
   Project-specific notes go in a data file, never in a structural README.
