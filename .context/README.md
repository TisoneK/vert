# .context_ledger/ — Agent Memory + Vendored Protocol

<!-- CORE-OWNED — refreshed from core/templates/ledger-README.md on
core updates. Project-specific notes belong in memory/ files, never here. -->

This directory makes any AI agent — any model, any machine, local or
cloud — a continuing member of this project instead of a stranger. It
is committed to git and travels with the repo. It has **two zones**:

## The three rules that matter most

1. **Never write under `core/`.** It is a versioned, checksummed copy
   of the protocol package — updated only as a whole tree by
   `core/bin/ledger-sync`. Protocol improvements go to the package
   repo via `memory/office/flaws/log.md`, not into this copy.
2. **`memory/` is this project's data.** Write it per each file's mode —
   append-only logs stay append-only, `chore(ledger):` commit prefix,
   no secret values in tracked files, ever. The full spec:
   `core/schemas/ledger-schema.md`.
3. **Sessions start at `kickoff.md`** (one level up from memory —
   `.context_ledger/kickoff.md`). It routes you by agent type to your edition
   in `core/rules/`. Memory never chooses your edition — your agent
   type does. Check in at the roster before the deep read — signing is
   the first write of a session, not a wrap-up formality; the push
   claims your codename. For concurrent work, use isolated branches/worktrees and
   `memory/collaboration/events/`; overlapping changes require a peer
   agreement before implementation.
